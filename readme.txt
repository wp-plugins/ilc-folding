== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which is the version of jQuery that this plugin uses? =
The plugin enqueues the jQuery version included in WordPress. As of version 2.7 WP includes jQuery version 1.2.6. But WP 2.3.2 includes version 1.1.4 so it will probably be ok. I haven't tested Folding with jQuery 1.3 yet. The version included with WordPress is safe to be used along with scriptaculous, mootools and other libraries.
